# NeuralNetwork
Implementation of a basic Neural Network in Java

I've found Machine learning to be really interesting, so after some reading on the internet, this is my interpretation of a neural network implementation.
Currently the network implementation is complete, but the learning and genetic algorithms are still in progress.  Updates soon.

Currently, only the sigmoid neural network has been implemented and tested.  
It does not yet have learning components built for it, but there are plans to do so.
I want to do both hill climbing and genetic algorithms to teach the networks so I can experiment with combining both strategies.
